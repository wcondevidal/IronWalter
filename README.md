## Documents
This folder contains various documents of importance that have been collected throught the bootcamp.
The folder is divided into weeks:
 - Week 1 documents - [Week 1](https://github.com/lillaszulyovszky/ironhack-case-study-classification/tree/main/sql)
 - Week 2 documents - [Week 2](https://github.com/lillaszulyovszky/ironhack-case-study-classification/tree/main/sql)
 - Week 3 documents - [Week 3](https://github.com/lillaszulyovszky/ironhack-case-study-classification/tree/main/code)
 - Week 4 documents - [Week 4](https://github.com/lillaszulyovszky/ironhack-case-study-classification/tree/main/code)

## Projects
This folder contains the projects that we have done at ironhack. 

**FlyingDucks:**
This project consisted on creating a one page summary of the findings on us job offers. 
Further project details can be found [here](https://github.com/lillaszulyovszky/ironhack-case-study-classification/tree/main/data_sets) 
**ERD:**
This project consisted on creating a ERD diagram of a restaurant network.

## Python



**Process**

Our ways of working included an iterative/agile approach circling through the following steps:

![workflow](https://github.com/lillaszulyovszky/ironhack-case-study-classification/blob/main/images/presentation/workflow.png?raw=true")

- **Github:** set up our Github repo to collaborate on. We did 104 commits in 4 days. <br/>
- **Trello:** set up our Trello board to help us keep sane and reprioritise daily.<br/>
- **SQL:** started with the independent task of completing the SQL queries<br/>
- **EDA:** assessment of dataframe to prepare for cleaning<br/>
- **Data cleaning & wrangling in Python:** drop 'customer_number' column, drop null values, convert float columns to int<br/>
- **Prepocessing:** 3 methods - Normalizer, Dummies and SMOTE<br/>
- **Machine Learning Model:** using scikit learn<br/>
**- iteration 1 (X):** In our first iteration we only used preprocessing and encoding and used this as a benchmark for the following iterations as comparison<br/>
**- iteration 2 (X_i2):** SMOTE sampling to improve the imbalance of the target<br/>
**- iteration 3 (X_i3):** dropping quarterly balance columns to reduce noise<br/>
**- iteration 4 (X_i4):** encoding numerical features to categorical ones<br/>
**- iteration 5 (X_i5):** using KNN on the i3<br/>

**Tools**
 - **Database:** MyWorkbench - [Link to SQL folder](https://github.com/lillaszulyovszky/ironhack-case-study-classification/tree/main/sql)
 - **Vizualizations:** Tableau / seaborn / matplotlib
 - **Code:** Jupyter Notebook - [Link to code folder](https://github.com/lillaszulyovszky/ironhack-case-study-classification/tree/main/code)

## Key Take Aways

### 1. Our model can predict a customer accepting or declining the credit card offer with an accuracy of 84%
### 2. We suspect the following features to impact the customers decision to accept the most:
  - mailer type
  - credit rating
  - income level
  - reward
